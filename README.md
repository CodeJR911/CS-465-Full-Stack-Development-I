# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development-I
Portfolio Submission

Architecture:
In our full stack project, we utilized various frontend development tools to handle server requests and deliver results to the client. One part of the site employed Express, HTML, and JavaScript to showcase the pages. Express and JavaScript were used to create routes and controllers for handling page requests from the browser. Express would then fetch the static HTML page or generate the requested page using handlebars templates filled with data from the database. These tools seamlessly collaborated to manage server requests and send outcomes to the frontend client.
On the other hand, the Angular segment of the project operated differently. When the page first loaded, the entire single-page application (SPA) was transmitted to the client. All page rendering and code execution took place on the client side in the browser. Backend calls were only necessary to retrieve data from the database. In contrast, with Express, numerous server calls were made each time the page was loaded or refreshed. Although the initial load took longer to retrieve all the code from the backend in a SPA, no additional calls to the server were required for navigating between pages within the SPA.
The decision to utilize a NoSQL MongoDB database in the backend was driven by the database's ability to scale effectively and execute fast queries. The document structure stored in MongoDB aligns well with JSON formatting, making it a strong match for integration with frontend applications.

Functionality:
JSON serves as a data formatting specification that can be utilized with various programming languages. It is closely integrated with JavaScript, a programming language that employs JSON for object definition. The frontend and backend components are linked through the utilization of APIs and JSON. In particular, RESTful APIs rely on JSON to process incoming requests and produce responses.
During the full stack development process, I have executed code refactoring to enhance functionality and efficiency on multiple occasions. For instance, I replaced static HTML pages with Handlebars templates to facilitate the reuse of page structures while allowing for dynamic content updates. Additionally, I improved efficiency by migrating the data used to populate templates from static JSON files in the codebase to MongoDB. This alteration enables seamless addition or modification of content data without necessitating website deployment or code changes.

Testing:
When testing a full stack application, it's critical to consider various API testing methods for requesting and retrieving data from different endpoints. These methods involve testing the functionality of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and PUT, which allow clients to interact with the server. Due to the complexity of full stack applications, it's essential to address security measures as well. In this context, security involves authenticating users and providing them with a valid JWT to access specific endpoints securely.

Reflection:
This course significantly contributed to my professional development by expanding my knowledge of full stack development. It introduced me to new technologies, such as Express, which I had not previously utilized. As a student pursing a computer science degree, my prior experience had been limited to working on existing projects other than ones in previous courses, so this course provided me with the opportunity to grasp the entire process of developing a full stack application from scratch.
In terms of skills, although I was unable to output the front-end screen correctly, I enhanced my JavaScript proficiency through the practical exercises in this course. Additionally, the chance to work with JavaScript on the backend using Node.js and Express was particularly valuable. Given that I seek a job in a project management type role, I believe that gaining a solid foundation in this in-demand technology has made me a more marketable candidate in the field Iâ€™m seeking.
